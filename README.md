## Glassdoor Project: Introduction into Data Science
### Project Overview
* This project was my first introduction into a full data science project. My goals going into the project were to obtain a basic understanding for the fundementals of data science.
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using flask
